## About BianZhiDai

**BianZhiDai** is a font inspired by shading characters in ASCII art and 编织袋 (woven plastic bag in Simple Chinese). Previously constructed in [GDC](http://glyphdrawing.club) (glyphdrawingclub, designed and developed by @hlotvonen and @i-tu ), turned into modular when doing the revision. 

BianZhiDai is good with colors, especially in combination with different fill/stroke colors. Try it, and play it. Besides, the whole font is modular based, so you can customize it in [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/) any way you like.

Xiaoyuan Gao is a Rotterdam-based freelance graphic designer, image-maker, type designer and the initiator of “notyourtype foundry”. In her practice, she loves experimenting with unconventional approaches to type design and typesetting. She sees type design (making custom characters into a font file) as making a tool for typing, just like a customised typewriter. She also enjoys creating visuals out of found images , which allows her to combine typography and imagery in playful ways.
